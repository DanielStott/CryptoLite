Simple Ransomeware for Windows

Here is a simple ransomeware created for Windows which encrypts all documents on the system with a key given from a C&C server.
For decryption the user is required to pay bitcoin to a certain address with a system specific hash created for that users system. 
Once the bitcoin is recieved the C&C server emails them the decryption key.
This code is only the ransomeware and not the C&C system.
